# Microcontroller
Explorations into microcontroller development.

Because one cannot fork their own repository and I want to avoid ever accidentally force pushing to branches that other's might pull from, I create branches named xxx_fork. Do not pull from these and do not have your own fork branches track them. Any branch name that doesn't end in _fork is a normal branch and can be tracked in the usual way.
